# Data Structures and Algorithms

It's time.

## Goal

I struggled with [LeetCode - Meeting Rooms III](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-iii); I did
eventually get it to be performant enough, but my solution was all wrong- apparently I needed to use two MinHeaps.

Which lead to the question, what the hell is a MinHeap?

So, in this repo, I'm gonna learn data structures and algorithms by implementing them and hoping that'll work.

## Approach

I don't know exactly what to cover, but I've been watching some videos and doing some reading, so we'll do something
like:

- Array
  - Linear search to find element
  - Fixed length sliding window to find sequence of known length
  - Variable length sliding window to find longest sequence of repeating pattern
- Hash Set (using builtins vs from scratch)
  - Remove duplicates from array
- Hash Map (using builtins vs from scratch)
  - Count occurrence of strings in array
- Linked List
  - Reverse a singly-linked list
  - Rotate a singly-linked list
  - Find the middle of linked list (two pointer technique)
  - Create a doubly-linked list
  - Create a stack from a doubly-linked list
  - Create a queue from a doubly-linked list
- Binary Tree
  - Get deepest binary tree path (using a queue)
  - Get broadest binary tree level
  - Invert binary tree
- Heap
  - Create a min heap
  - Create a max heap
  - Create a min priority queue
- Problems
  1. Find longest substring without repeating characters (sliding window and hash set)
  2. Design a LRU cache (hash map and doubly linked list)
  3. Implement shortest path algorithm for a social network (graph traversal and Dijkstra's algorithm)

## TODO

- Rotate a binary tree?
- Balance a binary tree?
